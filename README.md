# Generative-Adversarial-Networks
Generative Adversarial Networks for Generating MNIST digits.

Before explaining the Project, I would like to give a brief introduction about GAN's

## What is GAN's ?
Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs are a model architecture for training a generative model, and it is most common to use deep learning models in this architecture.
<b>Yann LeCun</b> described it as <b>“the most interesting idea in the last 10 years in Machine Learning”</b><br>
<p>
In short GANs can create images that look like photographs of human faces, even though the faces don’t belong to any real person just like the <b>Monalisa</b>.
